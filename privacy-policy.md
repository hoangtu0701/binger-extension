## Data Collection

We only collect the minimum data required to enable core functionality:

- No personally identifiable information (e.g., full name, address, email)
- No financial, health, or location data
- No web browsing history
- No behavioral tracking, analytics, or advertising identifiers

## Data Usage

- Chat messages are used solely for real-time communication between users during a shared watch session.
- Anonymous identifiers are used only to manage session participation and are not persisted beyond the session.

---

## Third-Party Services

- We use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) by Google for:
  - Anonymous authentication
  - Real-time database communication (chat, room sync)

All data is transmitted securely and is not shared with any third parties.
